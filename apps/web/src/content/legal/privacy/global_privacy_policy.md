# Global Privacy Policy

## 1. Universal Scope
SinapCode operates globally. We adhere to the strictest data protection standard applicable to your region. In case of conflict, the standard offering the *highest* level of protection to the user prevails (Privacy by Design).

## 2. Children's Privacy (COPPA & GDPR-K Strict Compliance)
**Protecting minors is our #1 priority.**
*   **Age Gating:** Users under 13 (USA) or 16 (EU) MUST have verified parental consent via "Verifiable Parental Consent" methods (Credit Card Transaction or Government ID Match).
*   **Zero-Data Collection:** We do NOT collect geolocation, behavioral strings, or persistent identifiers for users flagged as minors.
*   **Kids Safe Harbor:** We are audited by [Safe Harbor Certified Body].

## 3. Your Rights (The "Global Bill of Data Rights")
Regardless of where you live, SinapCode grants you:
*   **Right to Forget:** Permanent deletion of all records upon request (within 24h).
*   **Right to Portability:** Download all your progress in standard JSON/XML format.
*   **Do Not Sell My Info:** STRICT opt-out of any third-party data sharing.

## 4. International Data Transfers
Data is processed in AWS Regions (US-East-1, EU-Frankfurt). We use **Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)** and **Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs)** to legalize transfers outside the EEA.
