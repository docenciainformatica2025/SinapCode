**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

### How to Report

You should receive a response within 24 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

### Disclosure Policy

-   We ask that you do not disclose the issue to the public until we have had a reasonable amount of time to analyze and correct the reported vulnerability.
-   We ask that you do not use the vulnerability to access or manipulate user data without explicit permission.

### Bounty Program

We currently do not offer a paid bug bounty program, but we will happily acknowledge your contribution in our Hall of Fame section if you are the first to report the issue and we make a code change as a result.
