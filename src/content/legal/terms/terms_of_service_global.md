# Universal Terms of Service

## 1. Global Acceptance
By accessing SinapCode, you agree to these terms. These terms constitute a binding international agreement.

## 2. Arbitration & Class Action Waiver
**Dispute Resolution:** In the event of any dispute, claim, or controversy, parties agree to binding **International Arbitration** administered by the AAA (American Arbitration Association) or ICC (International Chamber of Commerce), conducted in English.
**Waiver:** YOU AGREE TO WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT.

## 3. Code of Conduct (Global Citizenship)
Users must adhere to the **SinapCode Global Ethos**:
*   **Zero Tolerance:** Use of hate speech, discriminatory language, or harassment results in immediate, permanent ban (Global IP Ban).
*   **Academic Integrity:** Cheating carries a cross-platform flagging visible to partner institutions.

## 4. Liability & disclaimer
To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law (e.g., excluding EU Consumer Rights), services are provided "AS IS".
